Exercise 1-1 (10 points) 

Implemented a tail-recursive function {loop} which linearly searches for the smallest natural number n which evaluates to n! mod 2^32 == 0. N = 34, as 34! in a 32 bit integer representation evauluates to 0.

Exercise 1-2 (10 points) 

Implemented a tail-recursive binary search function which searches for the largest integer m that satifises the definition of an integer square root of n. It makes use of a moving "divider" inside the space of possible answers [1,n/2] using a low and high value (i,j).
