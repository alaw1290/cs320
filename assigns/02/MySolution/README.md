Exercise 2-1 (10 points) 

Show triangle calls two inner functions, both of which are tail-recursive. triangle() determines the number of stars and empty spaces are at each "level" of the triangle, while construct_triangle_level() prints out the corresponding stars and spaces in order. 

Exercise 2-2 (10 points) 

print_digit_3 and print_digit_6 are hardcoded strings with formatting to print out 9x9 characters of 3 and 6 using Xs and empty spaces.

Exercise 2-3 (10 points) 

Using solce-one-recur as a model, this function uses a general case recursive solver to calculate the time complexity of merge-sort. Solve() has four main parts: the base case test, the base value, the recursive arguments, and the assembly after which constructs the final answer.
